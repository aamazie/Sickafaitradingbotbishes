This bot is broken in like one place. It needs an api function you can figure it out because why tf would I give you a bot like this whole . This is the first iteration and I have written bots since 2018. Specifically BTC trading bots like this that trade on Coinbase. You need Coinbase trading api and news api.. youâ€™ll see in the code.

it needs some api keys. youll see in the code.

python script. run it in a cloud server with npm pm-2.

perpetually runs.

prob won't crash but it's sentiment analysis from gpt4.


ok. the error is in the amount=.01. you coullllld find the coinbase api function to you full amount but trading is really based on bet sizes. you can win a hand in poker but in the end you win with how big your bets are or arent based on the situation...
